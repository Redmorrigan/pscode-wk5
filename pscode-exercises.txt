// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
	1. Start
	2. WRITE "Please enter two numbers to add"
	3. READ number 1
	4. READ number 2
	5. Sum = num1+num2
	6. WRITE Sum
	7. End


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

	1. Start
	2. WRITE "please enter number"
	3. READ num
	4. Divide number by 2
	5. IF remainder is 0, WRITE "Even"
	   Else
	   WRITE "Odd"
	6. End

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


a)
	1. Start
	2. WRITE "Please enter 5 numbers"
	3. READ num1,num2,num3,num4,num5

	   

b)
	4. If(num1 < num2)
		Set max to num2
	   Else
		Set max to num1
	   If(num3 > max)
		Set max to num3
	   If(num4 > max)
		Set max to num4
	   If(num5 > max)
		Set max to num5

c)
	6. If(num1 > num2)
		Set min to num2
	   Else
		Set min to num1
	   If(num3 < min)
		Set min to num3
	   If(num4 < min)
		Set min to num4
	   If(num5 < min)
		Set min to num5
	  
d)	7. WRITE "The average is"
		avg= (num1+num2+num3+num4+num5)
	   
	   WRITE avg

	   WRITE "the max is"
	   WRITE max

	   WRITE "The min is"
	   WRITE min
